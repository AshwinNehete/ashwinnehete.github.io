<!-- ## To study the effect of powder deposition strategies on warping -->
## Thermo-Mechanical Modelling of Multi-Track Laser Cladding

* Under the guidance of Prof. A.K.Nath (Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Kharagpur), modelled the heat affected zone and phase transformation at the clad-substrate interface in LMD.
* Aimed at modelling the effects of powder deposition strategies like hatching and preheating on warping that occur during laser metal deposition process.
* Developed a numerical model and simulation using FEM to predict the heat affected zone and study dimensional dependance of generation of residual stresses at the clad-substrate interface for first clad layer​.
> The thesis titled, “Thermo-Mechanical Modelling of Multi-Track Laser Cladding” was nominated for Best BTP Award.
