This is Ashwin Nehete's home on the web!

I am a 2nd year Masters student in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Carnegie Mellon University conducting research in Computational Engineering and Robotics Lab (CERLAB). Under the guidance of [Prof. Kenji Shimada](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/shimada-kenji.html), I am working on robotic depowdering and metrology system that can be applied to various [Additive Manufacturing (AM)](https://engineering.cmu.edu/news-events/news/2019/06/28-nasa-uli.html) machines and processes.

I completed my bachelor's from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at IIT Kharagpur where my academic and research interests lie in the areas of additive manufacturing and clean and sustainable manufacturing technologies and process development.

In May 2020, I successfully defended my bachelor's thesis, conducting research under Prof. A.K.Nath at the Laser Material Processing laboratory, IIT Kharagpur. My undergraduate work experiences include leading the mechanical team at the Autonomous Ground Vehicle Research Group advised by Prof. Debashish Chakravarty, pursuing summer internship at Curtiss-Wright (Williams Control, Pune) where I worked on optimization of production and assembly lines.
