`Summer Internship - Pune, India (May-Jul 2019)`

## Engineering Design Department
Wear prediction for dry revolute joint with clearance in multibody system by integrating dynamics model and wear model
:   The objective of this task was to study the wear phenomenon of dry revolute clearance joints in multibody systems based on the Archardâ€™s wear model computational methodology.

* Force analysis of a JCB Hand Control Lever

> The task was to provide a theoretical model to account for the force required to rotate the JCB Hand Control Lever.
> The amount of force required to rotate the lever finds its direct dependence on the amount of compression of the wave spring.

## Manufacturing and Production Department
* Implemented image processing using OpenCV libraries and Raspberry Pi hardware to detect flaws during part assembly to significantly reduce part rejection percentage on the production line.
* Acquired knowledge on PFMEA (Process Failure Mode and Effect Analysis), inventory management, maintaining employee skill matrix, daily production yield and delivery accuracy.

## Quality Engineering Department
* Involved in the study of 7 QC Tools, 8D Method for problem solving, MSA (Measurement System Analysis), SPC (Statistical Process Controls) for assembly process optimisation.
* Investigated the technical specifications and engineering design procedure by studying the drawing standards, dimensioning and tolerancing followed during New Product Design.
* Analysed the tolerance values of the parts , identified inefficiencies and suggested corrective action.
* Conducted lever break test, spring fatigue and force test and worked on CMM (Coordinate Measuring Machine) to inspect dimensional accuracy of the job before approving the part for production.

## Supply Chain Management Department
* Carried out careful inspection of PPAP (Production Part Approval Process) to generate Bill of Material (BOM) for a product to maximise production effectiveness.
* Coordinated with the CSR Department on processing orders, handling customer complaints, customer scheduling to ensure on-time delivery (OTD) to the customers, supplier selection procedure (SSP), purchase requisition and raw material import procedure.
