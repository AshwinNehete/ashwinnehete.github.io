The design, development and validation of the Eklavya 6.0 have been presented in this paper. Eklavya 6.0, a three-wheeled differential drive autonomous robot which can navigate to prespecified GPS coordinates as well as through lanes was developed to participate in the Autonomous Navigation Challenge of the 26th Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition (IGVC). Mechanical, Electronic, Software architecture sub-modules including localization, lane detection navigation and motion planning have been discussed.
