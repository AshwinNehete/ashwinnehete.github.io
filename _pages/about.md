This is Ashwin Nehete's home on the web!

I am a Robotics Engineer at [Path Robotics](https://www.path-robotics.com) enabling robots to autonomously see, understand and weld parts.

<!-- I’m on the job market! Please [send me an email](mailto:anehete@andrew.cmu.edu) if you think I’d be a good fit for your company. -->

I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in May 2022 with Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering. I spent time as a student researcher at Computational Engineering and Robotics Lab (CERLAB) advised by [Prof. Kenji Shimada](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/shimada-kenji.html). I was working on depowdering and metrology systems involving robotic arms that can be applied to various [Additive Manufacturing (AM)](https://engineering.cmu.edu/news-events/news/2019/06/28-nasa-uli.html) machines and processes.

I completed my Bachelor of Technology from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at IIT Kharagpur where my academic and research interests scaled to feilds of additive manufacturing and clean and sustainable manufacturing technologies and process development.

In May 2020, I successfully defended my bachelor's thesis, conducting research under [Prof. A.K.Nath](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=x4d3kg8AAAAJ&hl=en) at the Laser Material Processing Laboratory, IIT Kharagpur. My undergraduate work experiences include leading the mechanical team at the [Autonomous Ground Vehicle Research Group](http://www.agv.iitkgp.ac.in/index) advised by Prof. Debashish Chakravarty, pursuing summer internship at [Curtiss-Wright Industrial Division](https://www.curtisswright.com/home/default.aspx) (Williams Control, Pune) where I worked on optimization of production and assembly lines.
