* Wear prediction for dry revolute joint with clearance in multibody system by integrating dynamics model and wear model
    * The objective of this task is to study the wear phenomenon of dry revolute clearance joints in multibody systems based on the Archardâ€™s wear model computational methodology.
* Force analysis of a JCB Hand Control Lever
    * The task was to provide a theoretical model to account for the force required to rotate the JCB Hand Control Lever.
    * The amount of force required to rotate the lever finds its direct dependence on the amount of compression of the wave spring.
