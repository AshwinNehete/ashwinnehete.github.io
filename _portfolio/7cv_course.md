## Spatial Pyramid Matching for Scene Classification
* Built a representation based on bags of visual words and use spatial pyramid matching for classifying the scene categories.
* The program is able to classify images into 8 types of scenes. The following figure illustrates the overview of the Bag-of-words approach implemented in this task :
